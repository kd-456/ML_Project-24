Forecasting Monthly Rainfall with Classical Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Approach for Subdivision-Level Predictions
We are observing rainfall patterns and other metrelogical variables for three decades (1990-2020)



Accurate monthly rainfall prediction is crucial for vari-
ous sectors, including agriculture, water resource manage-
ment, and disaster preparedness. Stakeholders, particularly
farmers, rely on precise forecasts to make informed deci-
sions regarding crop planting, irrigation scheduling, and
water conservation. Here, we have analyzed rainfall pat-
terns and leveraged the results from there to decide how
much data to use for training while predicting for a specific
year. We aim to use different models for this and compare
their performances.
